<P class="ourmission"> In terms of clothes, what ways do you see people express their personalities or interest? Shirts? Sweatshirts? Jackets? Shorts/Pants? Shoes? These are the main ways in which people show off their personalities and interests. Why don't people show these things with their socks though? Socks are a great, simple, and subtle way to show off your interests and personality!<br><br> Our mission is simple:to make socks that people can display their personality with. Cool Socks™ are the perfect socks for you to show off your personality! You can wear our socks as a statement piece in an outfit, or they can be an accent to other articles of clothing. We have socks for every occasion! We have socks for the gym, golf, professional settings, casual, and more. We even can make custom socks!  </P>
<h2> Our Story:</h2>
<p class="ourstory"> In my senior year of high school in Civics class, I completed a project where we had to create a business (that sold a product). For this project, I chose to create a sock company. This is when I realized that socks are an underutilized article of clothing in terms of showing off ones personality. Thats where I got the idea for the sock company. Then four years later in my last semester of college, I had to create a website for a business. I thought to myself, "I already had the idea for a sock company back then, why not reuse that idea for this project." Thus, that is how this "business" and website was created! <br><br> - CEO, Tyler</p>
